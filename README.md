# Data-Science-Starter-Pack-
This project will document my learning roadmap for data science.
I am interested in medical research and aspire to master the basic skillset of data analysts. 
The Internet is full of resources and honestly it can be frustrating since I desire tangible results 
and not just some exposure/skimming of web pages.

My roadmap's principles lie in:
1) Applied Mathematical Theory (Statistics) 
2) Bioinformatics 
3) Data Mining/Machine Learning/AI 
4) Visualization Tools 
5) Programming 

These principles will be learned simultaneously/in combination. 

The Goal of this project is to learn the concepts and apply them to public data. You 
should have a couple of projects under your belt that demonstrate your understanding
and new skillsets. 

- Cheers
